    "notes": "### v1.18.0\n\n#### NOTES\n\n- thanks for the amazing work from molenzwiebel, poont, and several others, for the quick work on getting around the new damage data\n  encryption.\n- meter still does NOT touch the game files whatsoever. it does NOT read game memory, or tamper with easy anti-cheat.\n- AGS can still detect meter like they always have. it always has been a gray area, however they have never issued any\n  bans for it.\n- due to the workarounds, meter MUST be opened before entering the raid\n- due to the workarounds methods used, meter CANNOT be run in a vm anymore, raw socket also no longer works. meter should continue to\n  work with vpns, and ping reducers like exitlag.\n\n#### NEW FEATURES\n\n- updated meter for aegir patch\n- gem data added to skills on raid clear\n- class spec data added to players on raid clear\n- added a bunch of new tooltips to dps data\n\n#### BUG FIXES AND IMPROVEMENTS\n\n- fixed arcana knight card not showing\n- fixed surge skill showing only skill id\n- fixed artist t-skill buff showing in the wrong order\n- improved local player detection\n\nsend bug reports/suggestions to [ramen shop server](https://discord.gg/RXvTMV2YHu)\n",
